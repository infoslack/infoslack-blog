## Hi! I'm Daniel Romero.

I'm a developer, technical writer, speaker and currently SRE.

Twentys years ago I started my career as Sysadmin and I have worked several years configuring and maintaining bare-metal Linux servers. I’ve also  followed closely the arrival of server’s virtualization and the process of containerization.

During this journey I acquired new skills that gave me the opportunity to work as a software engineer with PHP, Java, Ruby and Go. In addition I worked a few years with pentest focused on web application security.

Over the years I’ve kept myself updated and embraced the DevOps culture, working later with many tools like Ansible, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, etc.
