## Hi! I'm Daniel Romero, a hacker and full stack developer.

I have over 10 years of experience with Linux servers and I have been 
working with software development since 2006, currently with Ruby and 
Ruby on Rails â™¥.

One of my recent accomplishments is [the book I wrote](http://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-linux) 
and also giving a [presentation]({{ site.rubyconf }}) on Metasploit at [RubyConf Brasil](http://www.rubyconf.com.br/en/speakers).

As a hacker, I'm a [security consultant](http://initsec.com/pentest/) and also hold [workshops on DevOps]({{ site.workshops }}).
