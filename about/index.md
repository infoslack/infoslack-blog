## Hi! I'm Daniel Romero, a hacker and full stack developer.

I have over 10 years of experience with Linux servers and I have been 
working with software development since 2006, currently with Ruby and 
Ruby on Rails â™¥.

Some of my recent achievements include writing 
[my first book](http://www.casadocodigo.com.br/products/livro-linux) 
and being invited to deliver a [presentation]({{ site.rubyconf }}) on 
Metasploit at [RubyConf Brazil](http://www.rubyconf.com.br/en/speakers).

As a hacker, I'm a [security consultant](http://initsec.com/pentest/) and also hold [workshops on DevOps]({{ site.workshops }}).
